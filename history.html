                        <h4>Like kanji, fireworks, and General Tsao's chicken 1, rock, paper, scissors was actually created in China. The game was created around the time of Christ, but stayed in China for hundreds of years. It wasn't until the 1700s that it made its way over to Japan. The rest, as they say, is history.</h4>

                        <h4>Legend has it, Roman soldiers invented the game of craps using knuckle-bones of a pig as dice and their armor shields as a table. Others believe craps originated from an Arabic dice game called Al Dar, which means “dice” in Arabic, and that merchants brought the game over to Europe in the 12th Century.</h4>
